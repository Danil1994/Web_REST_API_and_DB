Simple web application.

"I developed a web application using REST API and SQLite database. The application leverages various technologies such as Python, Swagger, and Flask to provide efficient data processing and delivery. It offers a range of functionalities, including generating reports and retrieving information about drivers. The application supports multiple data formats, including JSON and XML, and provides formatted responses based on user preferences. Overall, I successfully implemented a robust and user-friendly web app with efficient data handling capabilities."
