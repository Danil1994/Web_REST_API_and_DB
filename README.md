Simple web application.

I developed a web application using REST API and SQLite database, leveraging my own Python package. The package, which I designed and implemented, enhances the functionality and efficiency of the application. Additionally, I wrote comprehensive unit tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the codebase. The application, built with technologies like Python, Swagger, and Flask, provides various features such as generating reports and retrieving information about drivers. It supports multiple data formats, including JSON and XML, and delivers formatted responses based on user preferences. I successfully created a robust and user-friendly web app with efficient data handling capabilities, reinforced by the usage of my custom package and a strong focus on test-driven development.
